          <h3>The Pomodoro Technique</h3>
          <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Here's how to use it effectively:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Choose a task to work on</li>
            <li>Set the Pomodoro timer for 25 minutes</li>
            <li>Work on the task until the timer rings</li>
            <li>Take a short break (5 minutes)</li>
            <li>After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15‚Äì30 minutes)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>

 
        <div class="tip-card">
          <h3>Task Prioritization</h3>
          <p>Not all tasks are created equal. Use these strategies to prioritize effectively:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Use the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize tasks</li>
            <li>Start your day with the most important task (eat the frog)</li>
            <li>Limit your daily to-do list to 3‚Äì5 tasks</li>
            <li>Re-evaluate your priorities regularly</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

  
        <div class="tip-card">
          <h3>Time Blocking</h3>
          <p>Time blocking involves dedicating specific time periods to certain tasks or types of work:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Plan your day or week in advance</li>
            <li>Group similar tasks together</li>
            <li>Include buffer time for unexpected issues</li>
            <li>Be realistic about time estimates</li>
            <li>Schedule breaks and downtime deliberately</li>
          </ul>
